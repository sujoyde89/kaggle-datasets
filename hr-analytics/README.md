### The dataset for this analysis has been taken from the link https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics  

#### Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?  

We tried to find some answers based on the below features that we have available

Last evaluation
Number of projects
Average monthly hours
Time spent at the company
Whether they have had a work accident
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
Department
Salary

The target variable is 'whether the employee has left'

#### Motivation  
We tried our hand at creative feature engineering rather than black box models. We tried to create several features which will distinguish the target classes in the dataset more prominently
